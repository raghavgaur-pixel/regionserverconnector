# Region Server Connector
**RegionServerConnector** is a lightweight Minecraft server-side plugin designed for BungeeCord or Velocity networks. It allows you to automatically connect players to different backend servers based on their location in the world.

Perfect for large servers using a region-based architecture (e.g., dividing the map into zones or areas with dedicated servers), this plugin enables seamless server transitions as players cross region boundaries.
